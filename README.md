# Subgraph Counting Algorithm

In this repository contains the color coding technique to approximately count the number of non-induced occurences of each possible tree topology T with O(logn) verticies in a network G inspired by the algorithm in "Biomolecular network motif counting and discovery by color coding" (2008) by Noga Alon, Phuong Dao, Iman Hajirasouliha, Fereydoun Hormozdiari, and S. Cenk Sahinalp. The paper is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2718641/

tree_color_coding.py contains the python code of the subraph counting algorithm
